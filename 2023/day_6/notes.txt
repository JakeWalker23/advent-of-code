PART 1

- Holding down a button charges it up at 1 millimeter.

- This time is subtracted from the time

- The remaining time the boat travels at that speed

- e.g. 10 second race, distance 15

    - Hold button for 2 seconds
    - Leaves 8 seconds to race at 2 millimeters per millisecond
    - Boat travels 8 x 2 mmp/s 
        - boat travels 16 mmp/s

- If distance travelled > distance:
    - its a potential winner


- Multiply the amount of winning strategies per time.
